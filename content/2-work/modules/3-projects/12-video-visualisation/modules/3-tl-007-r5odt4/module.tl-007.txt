This project was at the beginning an experimental about what else is possible to do with videos. A video consists of various pixels, which vary in color and contrast. These data can be used to position a pixel in a 3-dimensional room creating completely new and fascinating pictures and videos based on the observer's location. The video below presents some of the most interesting views that I have generated through experiments on various video data.

Through more experiments, I discovered that in these pixel worlds, I can create surfaces between different pixels.   This has created many more advanced forms to explore. Many of these different shapes and patterns can be viewed in a book that can be found in the link below.
