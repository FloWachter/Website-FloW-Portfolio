Text: 

Ramona Barfuss is a Ceramic Artist from Switzerland currently working at <a href="https://khwurtz.dk/" target="_blank">KH Wurtz</a> in Denmark.

We met each other at the Zurich University of the Arts in Switzerland when she was studying Industrial Design.

Early in her studies, she already designed ceramic dishes with great passion and after various successes with her work, she decided to go for it as a fulltime job. She built up a brand called “barfuß“, and for that, she asked me to help creating a website. Therefore, I designed and programmed a website for her on which we both are very proud of.
