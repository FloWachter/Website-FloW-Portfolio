##Results and Failures
—
In conclusion, it is quite clear that the feature education has potential but in its current state, it needs a new way of how it educates people. Furthermore, Evasion failed completely. This is quite interesting because from the In-Depth Interview result it got discovered that people will accept taking power away when they see that they go saved for this reason. This could have several reasons, first, my design was not good enough or because of the Limitation of Research.
