##Literature Review
—
_The literature review is a critical essay that summarizes and evaluates the literature on a specific topic. Summarize, in terms of results or claims from prior research efforts on the topic._

The content of the investigated studies mainly focuses on the role of emotions and their negative effects on driving and safety. During the literature review, it became clear that research on positive emotions lacks empirical evidence and needs further research. Moreover, it becomes evidential from the literature review, that the most frequently studied emotions are: anger and sadness, and less considered were happiness and joy, surprise and fear.

I considered qualitative research because the subject of emotions and driving is too complex to be encapsulated by a simple yes or no hypothesis. Qualitative research techniques are richer and more insightful in the underlying reasons and patterns within phenomena. In order to conduct Qualitative research different Methods were used:
