Subtitle: An app that helps people with special food allergies to shop groceries

----

Text: 

Food Scanner is an app that helps people who have special food allergies or the want to avoid eating meat - like vegetarians, but also people who want to avoid to eat specific food ingredients. The app works with a barcode-scanner-web-technology and a specific filter-algorithm which works over a product database.
The filter algorithms search in the product description for ingredients which the user avoids to eat.
If the user is in a grocery store and wants to check a product to find out whether he can eat the product, he can scan the product and the app warns the user if there is a match with preset filter settings in the app.
