## Human Enhancement Product Research
—
To find a topic in the practical part of my bachelor thesis, I examined various implants and wearables that complete or extend the human body. I investigated medical implants, such as pacemakers, medical instruments but also NFC implants, which can be implanted in the body.
The study opened up the thematic fields of beauty, health, and sports, which was included in most of the reviewed products. To take a closer look at these themes, I have conducted interviews with doctors, athletes, and students.
