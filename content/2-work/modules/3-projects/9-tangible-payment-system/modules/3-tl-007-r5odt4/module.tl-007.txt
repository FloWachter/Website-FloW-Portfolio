Subtitle: A tangible payment system that treats collected data as currency

----

Text: 

Whenever we are using digital technology around us, we produce data. Truth to be told, nearly everything we do online nowadays creates some type of data, which is owned by the company who owns the platform we browse on. With the imple- mentation of new EU regulations, we see a future where we as users have first-hand ownership of the data that we are generating.
In this project we argue, that data will in 5-10 years in the future be used as a currency, much like money. According to this, the goal was to design a tangible user-interface for storing and paying with generated data. We used an autonomous car envi- ronment as a context to develop and challenge our idea.
