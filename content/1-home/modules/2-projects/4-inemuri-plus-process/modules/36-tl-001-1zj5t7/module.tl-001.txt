Text: Every year at the Zurich University of the Art, all students of the Bachelor's and Master's degrees present their thesis and designs that they have produced within the context of their studies. Every student gets an exhibition space, where the thesis and the designs getting exhibited. I showed two pieces, the first one was my sleeping wearable on a mannequin and my Bachelor dissertation on the side, and the second one was a reduced version of my sleeping wearable which visitors could actually use at the show to encounter a hypothetical post-human solution. This project was eventually titled Inemuri at the exhibition which I considered appropriate because this kind of sleeping practice combined with work-life balance is already practiced in Japan and they call it is called inemuri.
