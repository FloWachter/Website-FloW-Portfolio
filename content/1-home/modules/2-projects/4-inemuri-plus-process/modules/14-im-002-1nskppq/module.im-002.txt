**Dream Diary**
In the subcategory "Dreams" examined the topic "Dream Diary". Sleep and relaxation are for our body as essential as for the brain. Equally important to the human psyche is dreaming. Everybody usually dreams several times a night, even if one can not always remember afterward. The memory of your dreams is important for the processing of unconscious fears, longings, and strains. A Dream Diary is a written record of dreams. Important for recording dreams are the first five to ten minutes after waking up because dreams are quickly forgotten. To test how effective a dream diary is, I asked two subjects to keep a dream diary for over a month.

**Interviews with the Dream Diary Probands**
After the Dream Diaries, an Interview with the Participants was conducted, which generated new insights into the subject of dreaming.
