##Summative Usability Evaluation
—
_Summative Usability Evaluation is an evaluation method that is performed when a design is completed. This method can be performed as a Formative Usability Evaluation that the user has to perform tasks by using the design. Unlike Formative evaluation, this method is unassisted to simulate real-life use._

A scenario was created and tested with 5 participants as recommended by Jakob Nielsen in 
["Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users"](https://www.nngroup.com/videos/formative-vs-summative-evaluation/) for the Summative Usability Evaluation.
The test persons were 3 male and 2 female testers between the ages of 25-31 years old. The testing tasks were divided into Prevention, Education, Evasion, Motivation. Each task consists of sub-tasks. The test results which are necessary for the last iteration are stated in Summative Usability Evaluation Results in the thesis.
