##Patent Abstract
The present disclosure relates to a method performed by a body parameters supporting system of a vehicle for supporting obtaining body parameters of a person. The body parameters supporting system determines—with input from one or more surrounding detecting sensors adapted to capture a surrounding exterior of the vehicle—one or more body parameters capturing conditions for a person present outside the vehicle. The body parameters supporting system further communicates one or more instruction signals indicating one or more body motion and/or obstruction removal instructions, wherein the one or more instruction signals are determined in consideration of counteracting, changing and/or overcoming at least one of the one or more body parameters capturing conditions. The disclosure also relates to a body parameters supporting system in accordance with the foregoing, and a vehicle comprising such a body parameters supporting system.
