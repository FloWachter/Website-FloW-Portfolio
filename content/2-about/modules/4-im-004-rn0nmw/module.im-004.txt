**I am**

I am a designer who likes art, crazy futuristic technologies and to challenge myself. I easily get curious about new things and enjoy learning about new topics, which the variety of my projects and background suggests. 
Design not only takes place in my profession but also plays a significant role in my personal life; in side-projects with friends or in creating, coding and experimenting within Design. I also take care of a lot of hobbies, including skateboarding, surfing, and building and flying freestyle drones.
